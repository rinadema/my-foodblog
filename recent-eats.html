            <p class="text-center">Ema is a mediterranean restaurant, which happens to be one of my favorite cuisines.
              It is clear they attempt an experimental approach in their flavors. My friend and I ordered a side of brussel sprouts,
              a lamb hummus, and a hummus sampler plate. The zaatar pita bread (not pictured) complimented the different hummus flavors beautifully.
              The brussels may have been the best brussel sprouts I have ever had, with a subtly sweet flavor that didn't cover up the brussels' taste,
              but added a subtle depth of flavor that was very pleasant. One of the hummus flavors was an almond garlic flavor, which was an unexpected combination but made for a very light,
              refeshing taste. The only place where Ema fell flat for me was when it came to their traditional hummus flavor. It fell flat and was underwhelming in comparison to the rest of their
              options. A traditional, conventional flavor doesn't mean it had to be plain or boring.

              My friends and I did all you can eat at Sushi Payce and the experience was nothing short of fantastic. There is a great ambiance,
              the service was good, and the sushi was amazing! There is a risk that comes with doing all you can eat sushi. Sometimes, places will 
              bank on the "quantity vs quality" and the sushi itself will be subpar. However, that is not the case with Sushi Payce, each different type of sushi
              was a very enjoyable experience and I'd definitely recommend trying the "pink lady" sushi roll, it is a unique flavor I haven't tried before Sushi Payce!
              If you're ever in the Chicago-land area and you're a sushi fan, Sushi Payce is a <i>must</i>. No complaints!

              I was very disappointed with my experience at Egg Harbor Cafe. I ordered a chicken salad burrito,
              but was not expecting it to come with sauce and sour cream on top. For one, it made it a lot more difficult to eat-- I couldn't hold it without getting sauce and sour cream
              all over my hands. I ended up eating it with a fork and knife, which goes against what the point of a burrito is. The tortilla itself also got very soggy and almost inedible because 
              of the chicken salad's moisture inside. The chicken salad itself was also very bland and flavorless, and the sour cream was the only flavor I really tasted. The only reason I gave it a two
              was because my sister's french toast was decent, and the latte I got was very good. However, I'd say if you're looking for a savory breakfast, you should probably stay away from here.

              I was recommended to this place by a friend, and it would be a crime not to put them here.
              For one, the service was excellent and we were checked up on the entire time. The garlic naan was <i>really</i>
               good and not a single dish left me disappointed during my time here. The mango lassi was also the perfect amount of sweet and tart,
              and the chicken was perfectly cooked to where it was tender, but not exceedingly dry. (It was also a very reasonable price point for the portion sizes!) 
              Bring your family, since the best way to enjoy the food here was by ordering multiple dishes and sharing them with everyone around the table.
              I don't give out five stars easily, and I am positive that you will enjoy your meal here. What are you waiting for? Go try it for yourself!

              My order from was a buffalo chicken wrap with blue cheese and sweet potato fries. The wrap itself wasn't bad-- but that's all I can really say. I felt tired 
              of it after a few bites and wasn't super excited about finishing it. The fries had a great texture but severly lacked seasoning which I ended up adding myself. The place 
              itself was very cute, and my friend's italian beef was better, but I wasn't blown away by anything. Our sandwiches did come with a soup which was fairly nice. Overall,
              this place was fairly unmemorable and I am sad to say that I wouldn't really recommend.
