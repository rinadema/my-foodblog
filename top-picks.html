                     While this can be intimidating for a newcomer, you can never go wrong with the Spicy Shrimp XO Noodles. They're the perfect
                    amount of spicy with a good amount of peppers and onions to add a good change in texture.
                If you're ever at Joy Yee, you <i>have</i> to give it a try!</p>

                <p class="text-center">The beef bibimbap bowl at Soban Korea is incredible!
                    Unexpectedly, it came in with a wide choice of mix-ins so you could customize it to your 
                    liking. I've ordered beef bibimbap many places and have not had this option before, so it was a really nice change.
                    Soban Korea's prices are very reasonable as well. Not pictured, they also had a "Samanko" ice cream sandwich with a red 
                    bean flavoring which was the perfect amount of sweet after a great meal.
                    Couldn't recommend it enough!

                    Yolk Test Kitchen is known for their unconventional flavor combinations. I must admit,
                    when seeing a "buffalo chicken and mac-n-cheese waffle" on their menu, I was hesitant. However
                    upon trying it, it was my new favorite breakfast place! It's the perfect mix of flavors-- you get a bit of everything.
                    Sweet, spicy, and salty, this order can satisfy any craving!

                    If you should know anything about me-- I'm a <i>huge</i> poke bowl fan.
                    When I ordered this from Yatai, I was a little surprised to see that the bowl looked a bit plain at first glance.
                    I'm used to sauces and toppings overflowing, so I wasn't sure what to expect when I saw this in front of me. However,
                    I was surprised with how amazing the quality of the fish was, and the flavor really shone when there wasn't much covering it up.
                    It's definitely a different poke experience for me, and it opened my eyes to how little really goes a long way!

                    A sweet brunch is always the best start to your day,
                    and this churro french toast was heavenly. A soft middle, crunchy edge coated with cinnamon
                    sugar was perfectly balanced with the fresh fruit and mascarpone on top.
                    The presentation was also great, I couldn't wait to dive in right when it arrived to the table!
